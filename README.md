This is the C++ implementation of graph data structure. It supports the easy construction of undirected graph class and some basic operations on graph like adding and deleting nodes and edges as well as listing them. A function called "breadthfirstTraversal" is included for Breadth First Traversal of Graph in order to find friends of friends. 

Instructions for running:
<ol>Install GCC compiler.</ol>
<ol>g++ main.cpp Graph.cpp -o a.exe</ol>
<ol> Run ./a.exe </ol>
